# NOXX-Studio

My first realization that I made for Waldek van Deurse (https://www.behance.net/vandeurse), who is a web designer and asked me to cut the layout for him.

I am still working on a RWD quality and some other issues, so I'll be updating this project soon ;)

**UPDATE 5.11.16**

I think it's time to add some changes within this code. I just add .sass files and minified css output file to the project.

Next step is huge code refactoring, couse I wrote this website a year ago and it's full of spaghetti code. Soo... let's do some work with it :)

Here you can see a design:
