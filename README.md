# Noxx-Studio
My first realization that I made for Waldek van Deurse (https://www.behance.net/vandeurse), who is a web designer and asked me to cut the layout for him.

I used Bootstrap, jQuery and Google Maps as extented librarys. I also used a "Isotope" to manage grid system in "projects" section.

I still working on a RWD quality and some other issues, so I'll be updating this project soon.
